# Time Series and Linear Regression modeling Of The Future Yen

#### I have completed both time series forecasting and linear regression forecasting for the future movements of the value of the Canadian dollar vs Japanese yen.

#### Using the results of the completed time series analysis and modelling, I have figured out somewhat answer the following questions:

1. Based on your time series analysis, would you buy the yen now?
    * Based on time series analyis, I would not advice to buy the yen now because the long-term trend is a decrease in prices also the short-term (5 day) forecast is for the prices to fall. Also becausethe volatility is expected to rise.

2. Is the risk of the yen expected to increase or decrease?
    * The risk of the yen is expected to increase
    
3. Based on the model evaluation, would you feel confident in using these models for trading?
    * The GARCH model performed better on volatility so I would feel confident in using it for trading. I may need to use it cautiously.

4. What does the model forecast will happen to volatility in the near term?
    * Finally, the out-of-sample vs in-sample analysis of the linear regression model showed that the model performs better on out-of-sample data.
